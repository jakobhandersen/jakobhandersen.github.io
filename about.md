Welcome to my website
It is a site where I host my own small projects and it also functions as a kind of web CV.

As you probably notice, the site is currently work in progress - I am intending to move everything from https://jakobhandersen.dk to here...

A little bit about me:  
I am born in 1982 in Aarhus, Denmark and I currently live in Helsinki, Finland.  
My education: Bachelor of Arts in Musicology and Multimedia, Master of Science in Audio Design at Aarhus University.

â€“ Jakob
