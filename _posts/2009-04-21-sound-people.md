In the spring of 2009, I was involved in the development of an audio installation called *Sound People*.  
It was made in collaboration with [Sune Hede](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sune-hede-a0b12611/) and [Helga Rosenfeldt-Olsen](http://helgaro.dk/) as a part of a course at Aarhus University on interactive audio design.  
The idea behind the installation is to comment or sonify interpersonal relationships in the public space.<!--more-->

This video is a brief presentation of the installation:
