In the last part of 2019 and in the first part of 2020, I was the programmer/technician on the development of a prototype version (demo) of a graphic novel puzzle game for mobile devices (iOS and Android) called *Chadwick House*.<!--more-->

The demo contains 3 chapters out of 10 + epilogue in the full manuscript, which is written by [Boris Hansen](https://borishansen.squarespace.com/). The graphic art is made by [Kamila Slocinska](http://www.slocinska.com/) and the game is produced by Esben KjÃ¦r Ravn and his small company [Kong Orange](http://www.kongorange.com/). These 3 creative persons make up the backbone of the project and they are also the creators of the critically acclaimed game [Heartbeats - A Galactic Requiem](http://www.kongorange.com/heartbeats) (2014) to which Chadwick House is a successor.

For this prototype of Chadwick house, I was invited to join the team as programmer along with [Nicolas Vetterli](http://www.nvaudio.dk/) who has done the audio design and [Mikkel Maltesen](http://www.mikkelmaltesen.dk/) who has made image sequence animations.

> Chadwick House presents a peculiar combination of historic events and sci-fi twists while you play through 10 decades staged in the three-floored American house. Each decade has its own chapter which presents a puzzle. The player must solve the puzzle in order to continue. Solving the puzzles sometimes requires twisting your mind to uncover the fate of the characters.

The project was made using [Unity](https://unity.com/) as game engine and [Wwise](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/wwise/overview/) as audio platform.

Unfortunately I can not share a link to the prototype here publicly. But you can contact me or Kong Orange, if you are interested in trying it out or knowing more.
