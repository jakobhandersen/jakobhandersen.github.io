In 2012 and 2013 I was the programmer on two small iPad games made for the museum [Arresten](https://www.ohavsmuseet.dk/arresten/) in Faaborg (Denmark) which is part of Øhavsmuseet. The games were produced by the small company, Fuglen på Taget.<!--more-->

The first game, *Roger og Åge i arresten*, is a children's game that is built on a children's book series by [Jim Højbjerg](http://jimhojberg.dk/). Here, taking the role of the detective boy Roger, you must find your father, Åge, who has been kidnapped in Faaborg. Fortunately, you are accompanied by your friend, Casper, and your teacher, Pia, so everything will be OK.

The second game is perhaps more a form of interactive, informative app than it is an actual game. The app is called *Døm Selv* (in English: *You Be the Judge*) and it lets you get the chance to assume the role of lay judge. You participate in various trials, with all that this involves in terms of testimonies, procedures and so on. Then you need to decide what sentence (if any) the accused should have. The app also records anonymous statistics about users' judgments.

The games were free and could be downloaded from the App Store on iPad. I am not aware of whether or not they are still available on the Danish App Store - the two app icons below are linking to the address that would, at least once, take you to the apps in the (Danish) App Store.
