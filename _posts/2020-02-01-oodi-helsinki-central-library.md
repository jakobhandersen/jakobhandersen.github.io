From October 2019 to February 2020 (4 months) I was an intern at the newly built and technically advanced Helsinki Central Library, [Oodi](https://www.oodihelsinki.fi/en/). The purpose, from my perspective, was to give my Finnish language skills a boost as well as get some experience and contacts within the Finnish working life.<!--more-->

We moved from Denmark to Helsinki in December 2018 as my girlfriend got a position at Helsinki University. Since then, I have been working only sporadically, mainly as a freelance programmer / Unity technician on projects for the small Danish company [Kong Orange](http://www.kongorange.com/). But now I am looking for job opportunities here in Finland – to get a more stable working rhythm (and income) and also for me to settle more down socially. And to this end, my internship at Oodi was a great first step.

My tasks included helping out finishing the setup of the sound recording studio, handling various AV tech at events (including getting to know the nice [Soundcraft Vi 2000](https://www.soundcraft.com/en/products/vi2000) digital mixer), programming and setting up different projections on the walls of the library and quite a lot more.

It was a good experience for me to be at Oodi with good colleagues and a nice atmosphere in general. I think that I improved my Finnish language skills somewhat and I gained insight into some technical areas that I didn’t know about before.
