In the spring of 2010 I was an intern at Statens Museum for Kunst (The National Gallery of Art) in Copenhagen. As a part of this internship, I worked to develop a system that allows museum guests to paint on the wall using a Wii remote.<!--more-->  
I never actually managed to set it up at the museum but it was fun and interesting to develop none the less.

Below is a pretty lo-fi video presentation of the concept and system in a prototype setup:
