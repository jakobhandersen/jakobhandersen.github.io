In the spring of 2014, my good friend Peter Fjordbak SÃ¸rensen and I developed two interactive sound installations for the exhibition *Aarhus Rocks!* in [Den Gamle By](https://www.dengamleby.dk/en/den-gamle-by/) in Aarhus.<!--more-->  
The exhibition is about pop and rock music in Aarhus in the period 1960-2014 .

One installation was a 'recording studio' set up like the legendary [Feedback studio](https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback-studiet) where you could record a song and have it sent by email.  
The other installation was a kind of jukebox where you could listen to Aarhusian music from different decades.

Peter and I developed installations for the company Danish Sound Design, who had the contract with Den Gamle By.
