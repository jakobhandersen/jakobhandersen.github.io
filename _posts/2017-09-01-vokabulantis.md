In 2015 and again in 2017, I was developing techical solutions for the stop motion computer game, *Vokabulantis*. Vokabulantis is a game in development and it is a co-production between [Wiredfly](http://wiredfly.dk/) stop motion animation studio and [Kong Orange](http://www.kongorange.com/).<!--more-->

My job was to research and develop technical solutions for realizing the aesthetics of a stop motion universe in an interactive computer game. Among other things, we developed the procedure for having the photographed characters (essentially flat images) receive dynamic lighting inside the game engine (at the time, [Unity](https://unity.com/)). This was achieved by generating a [normal map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mapping) for each captured frame, based on multiple photographs of the given frame, lit from different directions.
