In the period from June 2021 to October 2024, I was employed at the small Finnish company [Anarky Labs](https://anarkylabs.com) as a [Unity](https://unity.com/) developer.  
Anarky Labs is working with creating applications for [AR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality)- and [VR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality) headsets to be used by people flying drones professionally.<!--more-->

During my time in the company, we were mainly working on two applications.

One of these is [AirHUD](https://airhud.io/) which is an AR application for drone pilots, giving the pilot information and visualizations overlaid the real spatial context of the drone. This can be helpful for professionals working with, for example, for search and rescue, inspection, law enforcement etc.

The other application is [AirSkill](https://airskill.io/) which is basically a Virtual Reality drone flying simulator, meant for training purposes. You are able to control the virtual drone using a real drone cotroller, in that way getting pretty close to the experience of controlling a real drone.

It was interesting to work with Unity in an XR context, which was all new to me. It was also interesting to work with different XR headsets, getting to know their capabilities, requirements, and way of functioning. 
During my time at Anarky Labs, we were mainly working with the [Microsoft HoloLens 2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens), the [Meta Quest Pro](https://www.meta.com/fi/en/quest/quest-pro/), the [Meta Quest 3](https://www.meta.com/fi/en/quest/quest-3/), and the [Magic Leap 2](https://www.magicleap.com/magic-leap-2) headsets.

One of my tasks was setting up, and maintaining, a project structure where we could support all of these platforms without having (too much) duplicate code.

I really learnt a lot in this period at Anarky Labs, both in relation to Unity and C# but also in relation to other areas such as [XR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_reality), [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), and implementing [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) workflows with GitHub.

I am grateful for my time at Anarky Labs with good collegues, good working conditions, and interesting work tasks.
