> A sound installation for the (hu)man peeing

In the spring of 2008, I and three of my fellow students developed the concept *Urinal Band / Fountain Orchestra* which is a sound installation located at a urinal.
It was first installed in the men's restroom at [Musikhuset Aarhus](https://www.musikhuset.dk/) for [Spot Festival](https://spotfestival.dk/) in 2008. Later the 'band' went on tour visiting [Skanderborg Festival (Smukfest)](https://www.smukfest.dk/) in 2009 and 2010.<!--more-->

With the band as a metaphor, each urinal guest becomes a band member and each urinal an instrument (eg. Drums, bass, vocals etc.) . Our intent with the installation was, in a humorous way, to challenge the many unwritten conventions that exist in public places - in this particular case, the urinal. We did this by sonifying human relations in this place where every relationship is most often avoided.

Unfortunately the installation was mainly accessible to the male sex but some women did manage to find their way in to the men's room, thus challenging yet another rule of this public space.

My three accomplices were:  
[Esben Nørskov Andersen](https://www.discogs.com/artist/3554853-Esben-N%C3%B8rskov-Andersen)  
[Mads Stenøj Andresen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/madsstenhoj/)  
[Brian Hauge Hansen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianhaugehansen/)

This is a primitive mock-up video we made while developing the concept:
