In the period, August to December 2014, I was hired by [Moesgaard Museum](http://www.moesgaardmuseum.dk/) to help with a variety of technical projects leading up to the opening of the new museum.  
My tasks included, among other things, programming and practical, technical setup of interactive installations.<!--more-->

It was a hectic period, particularly just before the openingÂ  on October 11th, but it was also really exciting to be involved in a project of this magnitude and kind.
